    Represents a connection to another area via something similar to a door and it's always to another DockNode.
    The dock weakness describes the types of door the game might have, which could be randomized separately from where
    the door leads to.

    This is the default way a node connects to another area, expected to be used in every area and it implies the
    areas are "physically" next to each other.

    TeleporterNode is expected to be used exceptionally, where it can be reasonable to list all of them in the
    UI for user selection (elevator rando, for example).
